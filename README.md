Arch Linux based container for debugging purposes.

# Notice
This is not a highly secure container and is not meant to be run continuously. Rather, it is for short debugging/diagnosing purposes, for example testing DNS or networking communication within a Kubernetes cluster.

This is also not intended to be of small size.
